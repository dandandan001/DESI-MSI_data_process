This project describes 
1. how to generate better quality ion images from mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) dataset: whole region plot and regions of interests (ROI) plot. (Python code)

2. Perfrom statistical analysis on pixels from ROI:
   Wilcox t-test (R code adapted from McCall lab, https://github.com/zyliu-OU/McCall-Lab/tree/main/03172021)
   Random Forest (R code, adapted from McCall lab) and
   Dunnett's t-test with boxplot (python code adapted from https://github.com/zyliu-OU/McCall-Lab/tree/main/03172021)
